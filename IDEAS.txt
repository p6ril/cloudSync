1. Allow for custom "hook" functions in FOLDER_LIST.
   Example use case: when synchronising a git folder a specific hook function
   could tar the .git directory and sync it as well as an archive.
   Hooks (if any) would allow to trigger specific actions per folder.

2. Building up on the hook idea, the main program could import modules
   from a subdirectory (if any). This way, hook modules could be added
   freely without any change to the main program.
