1. All rsync parameters could (should ?) be considered as options.
   The syncfolder function sets a common set of options for all rsync jobs.
   So far so good, but at some point it might be nice to allow for full
   flexibility and move all rsync configurations to the FOLDER_LIST options.

2. Allow for custom "hook" functions in FOLDER_LIST.
   Example use case: when synchronising a git folder a specific hook function
   could tar the .git directory and sync it as well as an archive.
   Hooks (if any) would allow to trigger specific actions per folder.

3. Building up on the hook idea, FOLDER_LIST data could be moved to a
   separate file and be imported into the main program. Also it could
   import modules from a subdirectory (if any). This way hook modules
   could be added freely without any change to the main program.
